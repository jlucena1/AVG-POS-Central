Object Number Ranges
For partners wishing to add their own objects to LS Central or LS Nav, and to ensure that those objects are correctly configured into LS Retail licenses, LS Retail has made available two types of object number series:

1. Value adding solutions for LS Retail- not for localization
Series: 99009650 – 99009699
These modules are for LS Central and should be used by partners to refine the LS Retail solution, creating their competitive edge and aligning it to their market.
This results in a cost efficient way to develop and provide add-ons to the LS Retail solution, and as this series is within the Starter Pack there is no need to insert additional objects into licenses.
Series: 99009500 - 99009649
These modules are for LS Central and are included in the LS Nav Base - Per Full User.

2. For localization
Primary Series: 10016800 - 10016849
Secondary Series: 10016850 – 10016894
These series should be used by localization partners for objects required for a local version to comply with local rules and regulations.
The Primary Series is the localization number range and should be used for localization. The Secondary Series is only used for an additional localized version for customer licenses with two localizations.
These series are within the Starter Pack for LS Central and within the LS Nav Base – Per Full users for LS Central licenses, ensuring that all necessary objects are configured into licenses for different countries (for which a local version of LS Retail is available).
